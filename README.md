# Crafting Intepreters

I'm working through Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).
This is the second half of the book, which the book does in C but I'm doing in
Go instead. If you're interested in the first part of the book, I did it (but
did not finish it) in Rust, [if you wanna look](https://github.com/mmcclimon/crafting-interpreters).
